## Description

This study guide serves as a place for myself and other bootcamp students to reflect on notes I took in the weeks leading up to my program start date. This should be very interesting to look back on in a few months and remind me of my motivation for going to a coding bootcamp; a before and after picture if you will. In completing this guide I got my first taste of version control, linking CSS files, creating JS functions and more.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
